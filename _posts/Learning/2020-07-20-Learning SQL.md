## Basic learning process:
1. Learn basic knowledge of database
2. Install a database (Postgresql or MySQL)
3. Find a good SQL website or book for reference
4. Build a basic mindmap of SQL grammar  (via an online course or a book)
5. Exercise and apply the knowledge at work (THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. We need to type the code by ourselves instead of using copy paste.)
