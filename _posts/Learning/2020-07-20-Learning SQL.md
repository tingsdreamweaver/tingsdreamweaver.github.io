## Basic learning process
1. Learn basic knowledge of database
2. Install a database (Postgresql or MySQL)
3. Find a good SQL website or book for reference
4. Build a basic mindmap of SQL grammar  (via an online course or a book)
5. Exercise and apply the knowledge at work (THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. We need to type the code by ourselves instead of using copy paste.)

## SQL Reference

### Database Documentation
- [PostgreSQL 14.5 Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html)
- [SQL reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html)

### SQL Online Learning Resources
- [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) Friendly interface. It explains the functions of SQL statements in detail, and provides an interactive online programming environment to experience the usage of SQL. No registration required.
- [SQLZOO](https://zh.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) For exercises.
- [W3school](http://www.w3school.com.cn/sql/) Quickly check basic SQL commands and understand the meaning and usage of SQL commands. Finally do a SQL test to see if the basic SQL concepts are established.
- [W3school SQL exercise](http://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/) The questions are rich but basic. It provides an interactive programming window, but the interface is not friendly enough. It is suitable for a recap after having mastered SQL in general.
