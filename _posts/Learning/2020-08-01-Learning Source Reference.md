## SQL Reference:

### Database Documentation:
- [PostgreSQL 14.5 Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html)
- [SQL reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html)

### SQL Online Learning Resources:
- [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) Friendly interface. It explains the functions of SQL statements in detail, and provides an interactive online programming environment to experience the usage of SQL. No registration required.
- [SQLZOO](https://zh.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) For exercises.
- [W3school](http://www.w3school.com.cn/sql/) Quickly check basic SQL commands and understand the meaning and usage of SQL commands. Finally do a SQL test to see if the basic SQL concepts are established.
- [W3school SQL exercise](http://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/) The questions are rich but basic. It provides an interactive programming window, but the interface is not friendly enough. It is suitable for a recap after having mastered SQL in general.
- [Planet MySQL](https://planet.mysql.com/)

### SQL Books:
- 《深入浅出SQL》-Lynn
- 《mysql必知必会》
- 《深入理解MySQL》
- 《数据库系统概念》这本书是dba必看
