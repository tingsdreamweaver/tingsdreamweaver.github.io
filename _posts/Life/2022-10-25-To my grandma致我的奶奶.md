## 我的奶奶

奶奶，我是小挺。今天你的状态还好吗？

有很多话，想趁着现在就和你说。因为我害怕我不这么做的话，时间也许很快就会让你把我遗弃在记忆深处的某个角落。你就权当是像听收音一样，听完这一段话好了。我猜想，也许你之前很多时候唯一的“陪伴”就是电视的声音吧？你会不会觉得，只有听到电视的声音，你才会感受到这个世界还是存在的，还是有人的？我能够想象，当你因为身体疾病以致于你再也不能离开那个公寓7楼的几十平米的时候，当你逐渐地对自己的生活失去掌控而身边又不能随时有人陪伴在一旁，当你在夜深人静关掉电视尝试入睡的那一刻，是多么地无奈，孤独和绝望。但我也知道我也不能真正地想象，因为没有真实地感受过那种无能为力和孤寂的痛苦，我用什么形容词描述这些痛苦也许都是片面的。我可能会一直站在旁观者的角度，和你大谈如何在绝望中心怀希望，在逆境中向苦难绝地反击，在孤独中艰难地寻觅自己对生活和爱你的人的感激。这些道理本身都没有错，但是他们实践起来有多难，却是我完全没有资格去评判，甚至是想象的。换做是我处在你的角度，能够做的更好吗？老实说，我也不知道。但是有一点我能确定，就是现在的我确实是在努力地改善自己的人生。我在积极地寻求破局的希望，我在感激那些真正爱我的人们并珍惜他们。 这句话我其实挺喜欢的，“种一棵树，最好的是在10年前。其次，是现在。” 也许我们在这个世界上的时间不多了，但是我相信，生命的质量是远大于生命的长度的。我们能够掌控的，不是未来，更不是过去，而只有现在。把每一天都当作生命的最后一天来过，那么你会突然发现你是多么地想要把这一天过好，多么地想好好对待身边爱自己的人，多么地想振作起来去感受这个世界的美好。我现在也学会了保有这样的心态，即使我明天不能存在于这个世界上了，我也会努力让自己在今天不留任何遗憾，然后有尊严地离开这个世界。所以我会拼命地过好自己假象或者真实的最后一天，这样，我的每一天都会有奇迹般的使命感。我的使命就是，善待给与我的时间，和善待真正关心我、爱我的人们。

而你，我的奶奶，就是那些无条件爱我的人中的一个。在我的成长里，有着你无私的付出和爱。在我人生中最重要的几个时刻，你都在我的身边，默默地包容和承受着我的恐惧，哭闹，任性，叛逆，不耐烦和忽视。在这里，我真心地感谢你为我所做的一切，也真心地为我当年的一切幼稚行为给你说一声重重的对不起。也许你会觉得祖父母为子孙后代付出是一件很正常的事儿，但这些却是我长大后不可磨灭的回忆。你所做的一切，和你的一切，都将最美丽的那一面定格在了我的脑海里。现在每当我在异国他乡想起你的时候，我脑海里印象最深的，还是那个印象中坚强，无私，爱恨分明和略带一些倔强的你；那个曾经牵着我的小手，带我去小学上学的你；那个曾经在温州寒冷而潮湿的冬天在被窝里给我做“火炉”的你；那个曾经在我面临高考压力最大的时候承受了我的忽视和不耐烦，却还是偏爱着我的你。我明明知道现在的你已经深陷于孤独和幻觉的痛苦，满头白发，面容憔悴，但是你在我的脑海里却仍然是当年那个坚强和干练的女人的形象。奶奶，也许你觉得你在这个世界微不足道，也许我们在这个世界上都非常渺小。但是你对于我而言，却是这个世界上少数最重要的人之一。那么你的形象也就会在我的心中无限放大，我的记忆，也许就成了你一部分在这个世界上存在过的痕迹和意义。所以，奶奶请不要害怕，我会小心翼翼地将你最好的一面珍藏我的心里，永不消融。

说到这里，就让我来和你分享一下在我记忆里的那些美好的片段吧。你也要帮忙一起回忆哦。

对奶奶你最初始的记忆似乎是小学一年级，你送我去上学，然后又在瓦市菜场校门口等我放学。等到我自己能上下学了，我记得你能很精准地从厨房的窗口捕捉到我放学回来，并且喊我回家吃饭。当时的厨房还在现在我房间的位置。厨房有一口很大的水缸。有一次，你用水缸里的水给我做凉粉。虽然材料是隔壁邻居阿婆给的，但是那个凉粉的味道确实是非常地香甜而沁人心脾。

对了，还有从7楼吊下来的绳子和塑料袋。小时候我忘了什么东西，就在楼下大喊，这时候奶奶你就会从楼上将红领巾，小黄帽和校徽之类的东西放下来。现在想起来，那时候每天上学要戴这三件套，在校门口被查还要扣分这样的事情真的是记忆犹新。不过这些都无所谓了。重要的是那套绳子和这个收送物件的形式真的非常独特，小时候的我也很喜欢从阳台上将绳子拉上拉下。说起阳台，奶奶你养过许多花儿，记忆特别深刻的有昙花和含羞草。记得当时夜晚的时候，昙花开放，在阳台灯光的衬托下，显得朦胧而轻柔。之后，你会把昙花剪下来，给我泡茶喝，说是对身体好。

还有一些你和我说起的回忆，比如你在小学里帮我大扫除，因为怕我自己做的不够好，而我还因为你的大扫除得了卫生奖。当时的我并没有想很多，现在想来，小时候还真是被有点被你宠了，还好没坏。不过，在吃的方面，我感觉我应该是被宠坏了。去了荷兰以后，我才知道，每天都能吃到海鲜，都能吃到热的三餐是一件多么稀奇的事。到现在，我每天吃一顿面包都觉得还是有点不习惯，总想吃点热的，好吃的。真的很感谢你，容忍了我对饭菜的挑剔和挑食，让我现在感受到，在吃方面被宠坏是一件多么幸福和难得的事情。忘不了晚上9点的时候你给我和自己煮一大盆金粉面加上肉丝和球菜，还正好是蓝猫淘气三千问和天线宝宝的时间。我们一人抱着一盆面，哧呼哧呼地吃地那个叫香啊。也忘不了我经常会在你炸完排骨和虾仁的时候疯狂偷吃，但你怕我上火都会阻拦我，让我等凉了以后再吃。我把你给我做过的饭菜，我喜欢的，都列了出来。一方面是为了守住这些记忆，另一方面也是想在荷兰这边自己尝试做着吃。很多味道都被还原了哦！下次回去做给你吃：）

还有一段宝贵的回忆，奶奶你知道的，就是我高三的时候了。那时候为了让我安心学习，你搬到上海来照顾了我一年。而这一年，我觉得也是我最想要向你道歉和感谢的一年。当时的我，似乎是完全沉浸在了自己对于求学梦想的追逐中，让我难以真正认识到身边的人的付出。然而随着年纪的增加，我对于自己内心和回忆的审视越发深刻，而这一段记忆也就越发刻骨铭心。我当时是没有想到你要来上海照顾我，是要离开自己的家乡，没有亲人朋友在身边的，是要一个人在上海生活的。我没有仔细地去想过，你会如何地去经历和消磨这一段时间。我当时真的是比较缺乏同理心，希望奶奶能原谅我。

发现自己说着说着又跑题了，说好的要聊美好片段的呢。还有很多的片段，等着和你打电话的时候慢慢聊吧。也许我们能够说上话的时间并不会太多了，但好在我现在意识到了这一点。所以，我会珍惜每一次和你打电话的时间。希望你也是啊：）

奶奶，在夜晚降临的时候，请不要害怕。让我们一起变得勇敢一些，在黑夜里找到自己的尊严和那璀璨的星空。

送你一首我最喜欢的诗歌之一的片段—狄兰·托马斯的《不要温和地走进那个良夜》。这里我用了巫宁坤的译本。

不要温顺的走进那良夜，<br/>
老年应当在日暮时燃烧咆哮；<br/>
咆哮吧咆哮，痛斥那光的退缩。<br/>
智者在临终的时候对黑暗妥协，<br/>
是因为他们的语言已黯然失色，<br/>
也并不温和地走进那个良夜。<br/>
善良的人，当最后一浪过去，高呼他们脆弱的善行<br/>
可能曾会多么光辉地在绿色的海湾里舞蹈，<br/>
怒斥，怒斥光明的消逝。<br/>
狂暴的人抓住并歌唱过翱翔的太阳，<br/>
懂得，但为时太晚，他们使太阳在途中悲伤，<br/>
也并不温和地走进那个良夜。<br/>
严肃的人，接近死亡，用炫目的视觉看出<br/>
失明的眼睛可以像流星一样闪耀欢欣，<br/>
怒斥，怒斥光明的消逝。<br/>
您啊，我的父亲．在那悲哀的高处．<br/>
现在用您的热泪诅咒我，祝福我吧．我求您<br/>
不要温和地走进那个良夜。<br/>
怒斥，怒斥光明的消逝。<br/>



## To my grandma

Grandma, I'm Xiao Ting. How are you doing today?

I have a lot to say, and I want to tell you now. Because I'm afraid that if I don't, time may soon let you leave me somewhere deep in your memory. You have the right to listen to this paragraph as if you were watching TV. I guess, maybe the only "accompaniment" you had in the past was the sound of the TV? Do you think that only when you hear the sound of the TV will you feel that the world still exists or that there are people? I can imagine, when you can no longer leave the dozens of square meters on the 7th floor of the apartment because of your physical illness, when you gradually lose control of your life and you can't have someone by your side at all times, when you are in The moment when I turned off the TV and tried to fall asleep in the dead of night, how helpless, lonely and hopeless it was. But I also know that I can't really imagine, because I haven't really felt the pain of powerlessness and loneliness, and any adjectives I use to describe these pains may be one-sided. I may have been standing on the sidelines and talking to you about how to hold hope in the midst of despair, fight back against suffering in the face of adversity, and struggle to find your own gratitude for life and those who love you in loneliness. These principles are not wrong in themselves, but how difficult they are in practice, I am not qualified to judge at all, or even imagine. If I am in your perspective, can I do better? Honestly, I don't know either. But one thing I can be sure of is that I am really trying to improve my life right now. I'm actively looking for hope of breaking things, and I'm thanking and cherishing those who truly love me. I actually like this sentence, "The best way to plant a tree is 10 years ago. The second is now." Maybe we are running out of time in this world, but I believe that the quality of life is far greater than the length of life. What we can control is not the future, let alone the past, but only the present. Live every day as the last day of your life, then you will suddenly realize how much you want to live this day well, how much you want to treat those around you who love you, how much you want to cheer up and feel the world beautiful. I have also learned to maintain such a mentality now that even if I cannot exist in this world tomorrow, I will try my best to leave no regrets today, and then leave this world with dignity. So I will try my best to live my fake or real last day, so that every day of my life will have a miraculous sense of mission. My mission is to be kind to the time given to me and to be kind to the people who truly care about me and love me.

And you, my grandma, were one of those people who loved me unconditionally. In my growth, with your selfless dedication and love. During the most important moments of my life, you were by my side, silently accommodating and bearing my fears, crying, willfulness, rebellion, impatience and neglect. Here, I sincerely thank you for everything you have done for me, and I sincerely say sorry to you for all my childish behavior. You may think that it is normal for grandparents to give to their children, but these are indelible memories of my growing up. Everything you do, and everything about you, has frozen the most beautiful side in my mind. Now whenever I think of you in a foreign country, the deepest impression in my mind is the strong, selfless, love-hate and a little stubborn you in my mind; the one who once held my little hand and took me to elementary school You who went to school; the one who used to make me a "stove" under the quilt in the cold and humid winter of Wenzhou; the one who endured my neglect and impatience when I was facing the most pressure of the college entrance examination, but still preferred me you. I clearly know that now you are deeply in the pain of loneliness and hallucinations, with white hair and haggard face, but you are still the image of that strong and capable woman in my mind. Grandma, maybe you think you are insignificant in this world, maybe we are all very insignificant in this world. But to me, you are one of the few most important people in the world. Then your image will be infinitely enlarged in my heart, and my memory may become the trace and meaning of a part of your existence in this world. So please don't be afraid, grandma, I will carefully cherish your best side in my heart and never melt.

Having said that, let me share with you those beautiful fragments in my memory. You also need to help me remember.

Your earliest memory of grandma seems to be the first grade of elementary school, you took me to school, and then waited for me at the school gate of Washi Market. When I was able to go to and from school myself, I remember that you were able to accurately capture me coming back from school from the kitchen window and calling me home for dinner. The kitchen at that time is still where my room is now. The kitchen has a large water tank. Once, you made me jelly with water from a water tank. Although the ingredients were given by the neighbor's grandma, the taste of the jelly is really cool, sweet and refreshing.

By the way, there are also ropes and plastic bags hanging from the 7th floor. When I was a kid, I forgot something and shouted downstairs. At this time, grandma, you will put down things like red scarves, little yellow hats and school badges from upstairs. When I think about it now, I still remember things like wearing these three-piece suits every day to school and deducting points when I was checked at the school gate. But none of this matters. The important thing is that the set of ropes and the form of this delivery item are really unique, and as a child I also liked to pull the ropes up and down from the balcony. Speaking of balconies, grandma, you have raised many flowers, and the most memorable ones are Epiphyllum and Mimosa. I remember that at night, the Epiphyllum was blooming, and under the light of the balcony, it looked hazy and soft. After that, you will cut the epiphyllum and make me tea, saying it is good for the body.

There are also some memories you mentioned to me. For example, you helped me clean in elementary school because I was afraid that I would not be good enough, and I also won a hygiene award for your cleaning. At that time, I didn't think much about it, but now that I think about it, I was really spoiled by you when I was a child, and it's not bad. However, when it comes to eating, I feel like I should be spoiled. After I went to the Netherlands, I realized how rare it is to be able to eat seafood and three hot meals every day. Up to now, I still feel a little unaccustomed to eating a meal of bread every day, and always want to eat something hot and delicious. Thank you so much for putting up with my fussy and picky eaters, and now I feel how blessed and rare it is to be spoiled when it comes to eating. I can't forget that at 9 o'clock in the evening, you cooked a large pot of gold noodles with shredded pork and balls for me and myself, and it happened to be the time for Blue Cat's Naughty Sanqianwen and Teletubbies. We each held a basin of noodles, and chirped and ate the one called incense. I can't forget that I often eat frantically when you finish frying the ribs and shrimp, but if you are afraid that I will get angry, I will stop me and let me eat it after it is cold. I made a list of all the meals you cooked for me that I liked. On the one hand, it is to keep these memories, and on the other hand, I want to try cooking and eating by myself in the Netherlands. Many flavors have been restored! I will cook it for you next time :)

There is also a precious memory, grandma, you know, when I was in my third year of high school. At that time, in order to let me study with peace of mind, you moved to Shanghai to take care of me for a year. And this year, I think it is also the year I want to apologize and thank you most. At that time, I seemed to be completely immersed in the pursuit of my dream of studying, which made it difficult for me to truly appreciate the efforts of the people around me. However, as I get older, I have a deeper look at my heart and my memories, and this memory has become more unforgettable. At that time, I didn't expect you to come to Shanghai to take care of me. I wanted to leave my hometown without my relatives and friends, and I wanted to live alone in Shanghai. I didn't think carefully about how you would go through and spend this time. I really lacked empathy at the time, and I hope my grandma can forgive me.

I found myself talking and deviating from the topic again. I said that I wanted to talk about beautiful clips. There are still a lot of clips, waiting to chat with you while you are on the phone. Maybe we won't have much time to talk, but I realize it now. So, I will cherish every time I call you. Hope you are too :)

Grandma, don't be afraid when night falls. Let us be brave together and find our dignity and the bright starry sky in the dark night.

Sending you an excerpt from one of my favorite poems - "Don't Go Gentle Into That Good Night" by Dylan Thomas. Here I use Wu Ningkun's translation.

Do not go gentle into that good night,

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,

Because their words had forked no lightning they

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright

Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,

And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight

Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,

Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
