<h2>About myself</h2>

<p>“The best time to plant a tree is ten years ago. The second best time is now.” <br/><br/>

  So here I am. Hello world! (What a cliche:)) <br/><br/>
  
  This is Ting and I am happy to share my thoughts, notes and stories with you. If you happen to be a 'late starter' as well, let’s chase together against the wheel of time.<br/> <br/>
  
  Let’s embrace our past, no matter how much we regret. Let’s live, enjoy and try hard now, knowing the fact that there is no unlimited time ahead of us. Let’s be hopeful and brave towards the future, since good things will also happen.<br/><br/>
  
  Dream, woke up, live, chase, feel, shine bright like a diamond, and fall like a star. <br/><br/> </p>
